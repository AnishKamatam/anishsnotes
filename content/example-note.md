# Example Note

This is an example note to show you how Quartz works! You can write notes using Markdown syntax.

## Features

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists (like this one)
- Code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, Quartz!");
}
```

- Links to other notes using [[wikilinks]]
- And much more!

## Linking Notes

You can link to other notes using double brackets: [[index]]. This creates a connection between your notes, and Quartz will automatically show backlinks!

## Tags

You can tag your notes (see the tags at the top) to organize them by topic.
