## Welcome to Anish’s Notes

Hi, I’m Anish.  
I’m a CS + Math student who loves working on systems, AI, and robotics. Most of my time goes into building things from scratch - backend infrastructure, ML pipelines, autonomous drone platforms, agentic systems - and trying to actually understand how they work under the hood.

I’ve worked across research and industry:
- Cloud robotics + distributed systems research at Berkeley  
- AI/ML engineering at startups  
- Building autonomous wildfire-detection drones  
- Full-stack + data engineering projects

This site is just a clean place for me to keep my notes: course breakdowns, concepts I’m learning, explanations I write for myself, and ideas I’m exploring. It’s not meant to be formal, just organized enough to be useful for anyone else reading.

Feel free to look around and dive into whatever interests you.
