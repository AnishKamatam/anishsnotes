Welcome to my digital garden! 🌱

This is where I share my thoughts, learnings, and notes. Feel free to explore!

## Getting Started

You can write notes in Markdown format in the `content/` folder. Quartz will automatically:
- Convert them to a beautiful website
- Create links between related notes using [[wikilinks]]
- Generate a graph view of your knowledge
- Enable full-text search

## Example Note

Check out my [[example-note|first note]] to see how it works!
